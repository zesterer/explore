A voxel-based exploration game to be

I have no idea where this idea is going, how it will go, whether I will ever finish it, or whether it's the kind of thing that can be finished. Maybe I'll give the game sentient intelligence and it can develop itself.

I begin with simply three goals in mind:

  1) Make a game that requires the player to think, empathise and make decisions without being forced by the game to do so.

  2) Make a game that is new every time you play it - procedural generation will play a big part in the gameplay.

  3) Make a game that teaches the player about the world around them, and show them that their actions have implications

I doubt I'll complete any of those objectives.

Anyway. Here goes.
